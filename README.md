> **Moodify** is a mobile application designed to enhance user well-being through personalized music recommendations based on emotional states and activities.
>
>
> By leveraging AI-driven mood analysis, Moodify creates tailored playlists, offers actionable insights, and provides emotional support through an interactive AI coach. The app aims to empower users to improve their mental well-being with seamless music integration.

### User Stories
**Normal User**
- As a user, I want to log my mood using text, voice, or facial expressions, so the app can provide personalized music recommendations.
- As a user, I want to access activity-based playlists, so I can find music that matches my current tasks or workouts.
- As a user, I want the app to track my mood patterns over time, so I can understand and improve my mental health.

**AI Coach User**
- As a coach, I want to analyze mood data trends, so I can recommend activities and playlists to improve the user's well-being.
- As a coach, I want to offer mood-enhancing challenges, so users can engage in activities that boost their emotional health.
- As a coach, I want to curate personalized music playlists based on user data and environmental factors (e.g., time of day, weather), so users have relevant music options.

**Admin User**
- As an admin, I want to manage and analyze user data, so I can understand app usage trends and ensure data-driven improvements.
- As an admin, I want to monitor and refine AI-generated challenges and recommendations, so they align with the appâ€™s objectives.

###  Moodify is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for the frontend. React is used for the web admin dashboard, while React Native powers the mobile application for a seamless experience on both iOS and Android.
- For backend services, the app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Node.js provides a scalable runtime environment, and Express.js is used to handle APIs and backend logic efficiently.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). PostgreSQL is a relational database that stores user data, mood logs, playlists, and activity records.
- The app also integrates [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for implementing the mood detection models, leveraging its robust framework for handling AI/ML model interactions and API endpoints.
- The app follows modern design principles and uses a clean and intuitive user interface for an optimal user experience.
- The app uses the font ["Avenir Next LT Pro"](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/avenir-next-lt-pro-regular) as its primary font, ensuring a clean and modern design for an intuitive user experience.

###  Architecting Data Excellence: Innovative Database Design Strategies:

Moodify uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), a relational database, to store and manage all application data efficiently. Below is the updated structure of the main tables in the database:

- **Users Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      password TEXT,
      spotify_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
      access_token TEXT,
      refresh_token TEXT,
      profile_picture TEXT,
      role ENUM('user', 'admin') NOT NULL,
      is_banned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      gender ENUM('male', 'female', 'other'),
      birthday DATE,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```

- **SpotifyUserData Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE SpotifyUserData (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
    liked_songs JSONB, -- Stores a list of liked songs
    top_artists JSONB, -- Stores a list of top artists
    playlists JSONB, -- Stores Spotify playlists
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```

- **SpotifyGlobalData Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE SpotifyGlobalData (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type ENUM('artist', 'track', 'album') NOT NULL,
    spotify_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB NOT NULL, -- Stores additional information (e.g., genre, release date)
    popularity INT, -- Popularity score
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```

- **MoodDetectionInputs Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE MoodDetectionInputs (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
      input_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., voice, text, facial expressions
      input_data TEXT,
      detected_mood VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      confidence DECIMAL(5,2), -- Confidence level in percentage
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```

- **Challenges Table**:
  ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Challenges (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
      text TEXT NOT NULL,
      type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Challenge type
      status ENUM('pending', 'completed', 'rejected') NOT NULL,
      time_of_day TIME,
      is_daily BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      completed_at TIMESTAMP,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```
- **Playlists Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Playlists (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```
- **PlaylistSongs Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE PlaylistSongs (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      playlist_id INT REFERENCES Playlists(id),
      source VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., local, Spotify
      external_id VARCHAR(255), -- External song identifier
      metadata JSONB, -- Stores song details (e.g., title, artist, album, duration)
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```
